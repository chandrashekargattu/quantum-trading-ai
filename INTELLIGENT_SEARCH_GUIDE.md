# Intelligent Stock Search Guide 🔍

## ✨ What's New

The stock search is now **intelligent** and **user-friendly**! You no longer need to type exact stock symbols or full company names.

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **Partial Matching**
   - Type `kotak` → Finds `KOTAKBANK`
   - Type `hdfc` → Finds `HDFCBANK`, `HDFCLIFE`, `HDFCAMC`
   - Type `tata` → Finds all Tata group stocks

### 2. **Fuzzy Search**
   - Handles typos and similar spellings
   - Uses advanced matching algorithms
   - Suggests closest matches

### 3. **Smart Mappings**
   - `sbi` → `SBIN` (State Bank of India)
   - `icici` → `ICICIBANK`
   - `bajaj` → Finds both `BAJFINANCE` and `BAJAJ-AUTO`
   - `airtel` → `BHARTIARTL`

### 4. **Auto-Discovery**
   - If a stock isn't in the database, it automatically fetches it
   - Adds new stocks seamlessly
   - Updates prices in real-time
