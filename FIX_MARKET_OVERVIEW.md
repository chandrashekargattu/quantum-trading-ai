# Fix Market Overview Issue

## Problem
The market overview is not loading properly after login. This is likely due to cached API responses from before authentication.

## Solution Added

I've added a **"Clear Cache & Refresh"** button to the dashboard header. This will:
1. Clear all cached API responses
2. Refresh the page
3. Force fresh API calls with your current authentication

## How to Fix

1. **Look for the "Clear Cache & Refresh" button** in the top-right corner of the dashboard (next to Account Type)
2. **Click it** to clear the cache and refresh
3. The page will reload and market data should appear

## Technical Details

The issue occurs because:
- API responses are cached for performance (30 seconds for market data)
- The cache may contain "401 Unauthorized" responses from before you logged in
- The cached error prevents new requests from being made

## What I've Done

1. **Added cache clearing on 401 errors** - If an API call returns 401, the cache for that request is automatically cleared
2. **Added console error logging** - Check browser console (F12) for specific error messages
3. **Added manual cache clear button** - Allows you to force clear all cached data

## Check Browser Console

Press F12 and look for any errors in the Console tab. You should see:
- "Market data error:" followed by the specific error if the API call fails

## After Fixing

Once the market data loads properly, you can remove the "Clear Cache & Refresh" button by:
1. Deleting `/frontend/src/components/dashboard/ClearCacheButton.tsx`
2. Removing the import and usage from `/frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

The dashboard should now handle authentication changes more gracefully!
