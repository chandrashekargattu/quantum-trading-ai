# Stock Management Features 📊

## New Features Added

### 1. 🗑️ Delete Stocks from Watchlist

You can now remove stocks from your watchlist directly from the UI:

- **Delete Button**: Each stock card has a trash icon in the top-right corner
- **Soft Delete**: Stocks are marked as inactive (not permanently deleted)
- **Instant Update**: The UI updates immediately after deletion
- **Loading State**: Shows a spinner while deleting

#### How to Use:
1. Go to the stocks page
2. Hover over any stock card
3. Click the trash icon in the top-right corner
4. Stock is immediately removed from view

#### API Endpoint:
```http
DELETE /api/v1/stocks/{symbol}
```

Example:
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/v1/stocks/RELIANCE.NS \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 2. 📄 Pagination

The stocks page now includes pagination to keep the interface clean and organized:

- **12 stocks per page**: Optimal grid layout (3x4 on desktop)
- **Smart pagination controls**: Shows current page and nearby pages
- **Page info**: Displays "Showing X-Y of Z stocks"
- **Responsive**: Works well on all screen sizes

#### Features:
- **Previous/Next buttons**: Navigate between pages
- **Direct page selection**: Click any page number
- **Ellipsis**: Shows "..." for page ranges
- **Auto-adjust**: If you delete the last item on a page, it goes to the previous page

### 3. 🎨 Enhanced UI

#### Stock Cards:
- **Delete button**: Appears on hover (desktop) or always visible (mobile)
- **Proper spacing**: Cards don't overlap with delete button
- **Loading states**: Shows spinner during operations

#### Pagination Bar:
- **Centered layout**: Clean and professional look
- **Disabled states**: Previous/Next buttons disable at boundaries
- **Active page highlight**: Current page has different styling

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- All stocks loaded on one page (messy with many stocks)
- No way to remove unwanted stocks
- Scrolling through long lists

### After:
- Clean grid of 12 stocks per page
- Easy deletion of unwanted stocks
- Quick navigation between pages
- Better performance with fewer DOM elements

## Technical Implementation

### Backend:
```python
@router.delete("/{symbol}")
async def remove_stock(symbol: str, ...):
    # Soft delete - marks stock as inactive
    stock.is_active = False
    await db.commit()
```

### Frontend:
```typescript
// Pagination logic
const STOCKS_PER_PAGE = 12
const paginatedStocks = stocks.slice(
  (currentPage - 1) * STOCKS_PER_PAGE,
  currentPage * STOCKS_PER_PAGE
)

// Delete function
const deleteStock = async (symbol: string) => {
  await fetch(`/api/v1/stocks/${symbol}`, {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
  })
  // Update local state
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Interface**: No more cluttered pages with hundreds of stocks
2. **Better Performance**: Rendering only 12 stocks at a time
3. **User Control**: Remove stocks you're no longer interested in
4. **Professional Look**: Pagination adds a polished feel
5. **Scalability**: Can handle any number of stocks efficiently

## Usage Tips

### Managing Your Watchlist:
1. **Add stocks** you're actively tracking
2. **Remove stocks** you're no longer interested in
3. **Use search** to quickly find specific stocks
4. **Navigate pages** to browse your full watchlist

### Best Practices:
- Keep only relevant stocks in your watchlist
- Use search instead of browsing many pages
- Regularly clean up inactive positions
- Add stocks by sector for easy organization

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:
- **Bulk delete**: Select multiple stocks to delete at once
- **Sort options**: Sort by price, change %, name, etc.
- **Filter by exchange**: Show only NSE or BSE stocks
- **Custom page size**: Let users choose 12, 24, or 48 stocks per page
- **Favorites**: Star important stocks to keep them at the top

The stock management page is now more powerful and user-friendly! 🎉
